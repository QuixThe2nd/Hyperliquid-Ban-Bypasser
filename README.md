# Hyperliquid Ban Bypasser
This is a Chrome extension that bypasses Hyperliquid restrictions. The extension intercepts the request Hyperliquid's frontend makes to check if you are allowed to use their frontend.

It bypasses:
- ipAllowed checks (region bans)
- acceptedTerms checks (lets you use the frontend without agreeing to ToS)
- userAllowed checks (e.g. Chainalysis flags)

I made this for personal use. Please don't use this for nefarious activities.
